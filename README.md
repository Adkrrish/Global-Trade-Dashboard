## Project Overview

The **Global Trade Insights Dashboard** is an interactive web application built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). It enables users to visualize and analyze global import-export trade data dynamically, leveraging powerful data visualization libraries such as **Seaborn** and **Pandas**. 

The dashboard offers users the ability to track trends, compare import-export values over time, and visualize complex datasets in an intuitive and interactive way.

---

## Features

- **Interactive visualizations** using **Seaborn** for analyzing trade patterns.
- **Filtering options** to display data for specific time periods or countries.
- **Line plots, bar charts, and heatmaps** to understand trade values and trends.
- **Dynamic and responsive design** that updates visualizations based on user inputs.
- Data export functionality to download filtered results for further analysis.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the project locally:

**Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/global-trade-insights-dashboard.git
   cd global-trade-insights-dashboard

**Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

**Install required dependencies: Make sure to install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt.**

pip install -r requirements.txt

**Run the application: You can launch the Streamlit app using the command below:**
streamlit run d_(2).py
Usage
Once the application is running, you can access the dashboard locally in your browser at http://localhost:8501.

**The dashboard will allow you to:**
Upload the dataset (if necessary).
Use filtering options to refine the data by date range or country.
View various visualizations such as line charts, bar graphs, and heatmaps.
Analyze import/export trends over time.

**Technologies Used**
Python 3.12
Streamlit 1.39.0: Framework for building the web application
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
Seaborn: For visualizations and plotting
NumPy: Numerical operations on datasets
Matplotlib: (Optional) Additional visualization support

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is related to global trade imports and exports. It includes the following columns:

Date: Date of the trade record
Country: Country involved in the trade
Value: The value of the imports/exports
Category: Type of product or service
You can update or replace the dataset by using the provided CSV template Imports_Exports_Dataset.csv. Make sure the column names match the expected format.
